IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR DUAL-MODE MCQ SYSTEM

Two Modes:
1. DESCRIPTIVE TO MCQ: LLM creates Q, Ans, Options from scratch based on difficulty
2. MCQ TO MCQ: Extract existing Q/Ans, check for options, simplify language or create options

Key Changes Needed:
1. Modify prompts to include detection and dual-mode logic
2. Update pdf_processor.py to analyze content and call appropriate mode
3. Enhance admin form to allow unlimited MCQ count (remove max 20)
4. Add page range selection for descriptive mode
5. Map difficulty level to subject table difficulty field
6. Create content analyzer to detect if PDF has questions/options

Content Detection Logic:
- Look for patterns: "Q.", "Ans.", "Option", "Q1.", "Question 1", etc.
- If patterns found: MCQ mode (extract)
- If not found: Descriptive mode (create)

Flow:
Form Input: num_mcqs (any number), difficulty (easy/medium/hard), page_from, page_to

    +-- Descriptive Content --> Descriptive to MCQ Mode
        - Create questions from scratch
        - Generate answers
        - Generate options based on difficulty level
